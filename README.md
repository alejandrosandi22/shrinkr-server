## Husky and Commitlint Configuration

ShrinkURL utilizes Husky and Commitlint for ensuring consistent commit messages and running pre-commit hooks. To set up Husky and Commitlint, follow these steps:

1. Install Husky and Commitlint as dev dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install --save-dev husky @commitlint/{config-conventional,cli}
```

- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
- `chore`: Regular code maintenance.
- `ci`: Changes to your CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `revert`: If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert:` , followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body, it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

Now, whenever you make a commit, Husky will ensure that your commit message conforms to the conventional commit format specified by Commitlint.
